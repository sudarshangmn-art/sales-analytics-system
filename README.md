Sales Analytics System

Project Overview:
The Sales Analytics System is a Python-based application that processes and analyzes e-commerce sales data.It handles messy input files, performs data cleaning and validation,
integrates external API data, generates analytical insights, enriches sales records, and produces a comprehensive text report for business decision-making.

Features:
-Robust file handling with encoding support
-Data cleaning and validation
-Interactive filtering by region and transaction amount
-Sales analytics (revenue, region-wise analysis, product and customer insights)
-Date-based sales trends and peak day analysis
-API integration using DummyJSON Products API
-Enrichment of sales data with API product details
-Generation of comprehensive text-based sales report

Prerequisites:
Python 3.8 or above
Internet connection (for API integration)

Setup Instructions:
1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/sudarshangmn-art/sales-analytics-system.git
cd sales-analytics-system

2. Install Required Dependencies
All required libraries are listed in requirements.txt.

pip install -r requirements.txt


How to Run the Application:
From the root project directory, run:

python3 main.py

Program Workflow:
When executed, the application performs the following steps:
1.Reads the sales data file with encoding handling
2.Parses and cleans transaction records
3.Displays available filter options (region and amount range)
4.Accepts optional user-defined filters
5.Validates transactions and displays summary
6.Performs sales analytics and trend analysis
7.Fetches product data from the DummyJSON API
8.Enriches sales data with API information
9.Saves enriched data to data/enriched_sales_data.txt
10.Generates a detailed report at output/sales_report.txt

Output Files:
data/enriched_sales_data.txt
Contains sales transactions enriched with API product details.

output/sales_report.txt
A comprehensive formatted sales analytics report including:
-Overall summary
-Region-wise performance
-Top products and customers
-Daily sales trends
-Product performance analysis
-API enrichment summary

API Integration Note:

The DummyJSON API product IDs range from 1 to 100, while the sales dataset contains product IDs starting from P101.
As a result, API enrichment may not find matching products.
This scenario is handled gracefully by marking such records with API_Match = False, as required by the assignment.

Error Handling:
-All major operations are wrapped in try-except blocks
-User-friendly messages are displayed for errors
-The program does not crash on invalid input or API failures

Submission Notes:
-This repository is public as required
-No hardcoded file paths are used
-All required output files are auto-generated by the program
-The project runs end-to-end without errors
